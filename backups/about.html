      <h3>"Who am I? Where am I?" - Neil Breen</h3>

      <p>I like to think of myself as a "fixer" - someone who can look at a random problem and figure out some sort of solution. This skill has been well utilized between all-nighters working on robotics projects, diagnosing and resolving instrument issues onsite at Formulatrix, or making a career shift to grad school for computer science. I solve problems. This is why I went into engineering and ended up where I am today.

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy hiking, biking, and gardening in the summer. Otherwise I am probably watching too many PBS spacetime videos (and not really understanding them) or tinkering on random projects.
