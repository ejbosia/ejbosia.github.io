            <p>I am the lead support engineer for the Constellation instrument. I have gained good design experience through dealing with the mistakes we made with the early version of the instrument. As part of the job I also work with customers to help identify and fix any issues they have.
            
            <p> <h3>Error Log Programs</h3>
            <p> To help in this role I created a few scripts to help deal with the messy error logs created by our software. All of these programs were written in Python.
