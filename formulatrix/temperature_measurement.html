            <p> The goal of this project was to determine the uniformity and absolute temperature of the heatblock we use in the Constellation dPCR instrument.

            <p> <h3>Arduino Temperature Plate</h3>
            
            <p> The first idea was to try to measure the temperature of the plate directly. The method I chose to do this was to machine a mock dPCR microplate out of delrin with slots cut out for the NTC thermistors we were using for controlling the heatblock temperature. To read the temperatures I used an arduino.

                <tr><td><img src="cc_U.png" alt="Picture of Arduino and Plate" style="width:600;height:600;"> </td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p> The Arduino code I wrote only broadcast an averaged analog temperature reading every second. I used a timer on the Arduino to regulate the temperature readings. To convert the readings into real temperatures, I used a python script to get the readings from serial and calculate the celsius temperatures. This program wrote the temperatures to a csv file. 
            
            <p> Eventually I gave up on this approach because the temperatures measured were far away from the actual block temperature. This is from the not perfect thermal contact between the plate and the thermistors, and the fact the thermistors were not only on the heatblock surface, but also inset in the measurement plate plastic, meaning the temperatures they would measure would be somewhere on the gradient of the plate. There was a thought to use this to simulate how liquid in the microfluidic features on the plate would react to different temperatures, but getting a repeatable reading from the different sensors because of the varied slot heights would be not trustworthy.
            
            <p> <h3>FLIR Converter</h3>
            
            <p> The next attempt was to convert grayscale FLIR values into temperature. I did this using a python script to process each pixel in the image. I used imagej to manually find the scale, which I then would input into the script to generate the interpolated results. This approach worked pretty well, but after doing some research, I found that FLIR had a prebuilt application to do this.
