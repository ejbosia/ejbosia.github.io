             <p> As part of the R&D process we aimed to determine the shrinkage rate of the plates after injection molding. Despite this project not working as expected, there are some interesting things I did to try to get it to work. The code was written in Python, using jupyter as a quick prototyping tool.

            <p> <b>Program</b>
            The program was broken into two scripts. The first script identified the ports, and determined the locations of the centroids of each. The second script calculated the mean distance from all of the ports and calculated the shrinkage.
