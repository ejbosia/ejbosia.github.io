             <p> As part of the R&D process we aimed to determine the shrinkage rate of the plates after injection molding. Despite this project not working as expected, there are some interesting things I did to try to get it to work. The code was written in Python, using jupyter as a quick prototyping tool.

            <p> <h3>Port Identification Script</h3>
            <p>The port identification script found the contours of the backlit holes in the plate, then determined the contour characterstics of the points. The holes were also identified based on their position in the image. All of this data was saved to a csv file using Pandas.
            
            
            <p> <h3>Shrinkage Calculation Script</h3>
            <p>Using the csv position data from each image, the plate shrinkage was calculated.
