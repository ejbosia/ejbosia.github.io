            <p> Dust is one of the failure areas of our microplates. We needed a way to quantify dust on the plates to figure out the most risky areas of plate production for introducing dust, and ultimately creating a score to use in the QC process.
                        
            <p> <h3>Dust Analysis Program</h3>
            <p> The first program took in grayscale images of the plate from the Constellation. It would then process the image and return a csv file of metrics for each image. Scores like the total amount of large dust and image standard deviation were used.
            
            <p> <b>Libraries</b>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenCV</li>
                <li>Pandas</li>
                <li>os</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> <h3>Image Scoring Program</h3>
            <p> The second program takes in image folders and has the user rate images on a scale from 1 (clean) to 5 (dusty). The program would display an image, and then the user could use the 1-5 number keys to rate the image. Once the image was given a rating, the next image would be shown.
            
            <table class="img">
                <caption align="bottom">User Interface</caption>
                <tr><td><img src="cc_U.png" alt="User Interface" style="width:600;height:600;"> </td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p> <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
            <p> The last step of the dust detection process was to determine a metric to rate future dust images. Using the scores from the image scoring program and the table of image parameters from the dust analysis program, a machine learning model was trained hoping to predict the scores. Overall the predictions were ok but would not be good enough for a production environment.
            
            <table class="img">
                <caption align="bottom">Image Score Predictions vs Actual</caption>
                <tr><td><img src="cc_U.png" alt="Image Score Predictions vs Actual" style="width:600;height:600;"> </td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p> There are a few things we could improve on the model. 
            <ul>
                <li>Add more images</li>
                <li>Get more "clean" images</li>
                <li>Possibly have more users play the image scoring program</li>
                <li>Possibly think of new metrics to use with the dust analysis program</li>
            </ul>
            
            The good news is that the programs would be able to handle adding more results, so it should not be too hard to fix these issues.
