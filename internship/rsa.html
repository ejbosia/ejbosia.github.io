				<h1>Robotic Test Station</h1>
				<p> RSA, the Security Division of EMC, June 2015 - August 2015
				<p> The major engineering project I worked on at RSA was creating a PLC driven test station to see if components I was salvaging from some of their decommisioned assembly robots still functioned. RSA had an automated assembly line in their Bedford facility for token production. All of the robots were driven by PLC's. I used the PLC of a decommisioned robot to run the test station. I wired in a few buttons for manual input, and a manifold to control the pressures to different components. As a project it was good practice for PLC programming and learning more about pneumatics and industrial robotics.
