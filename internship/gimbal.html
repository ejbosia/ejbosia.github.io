                <p><i> The gimbal would be very difficult to machine and I would put more focus on that if I were to redesign it. When I designed this I had very little machining experience, which I have since gained from working at Formulatrix.</i>

				<p> The three-axis gimbal was designed to carry two cameras: a 12X optical zoom 4K camera for inspection, and a FLIR infrared thermal camera. The design requirements for the gimbal were:
				<ul>
					<li>Gimbal must fully enclose cameras</li>
					<li>Gimbal must maintain structural integrity</li>
					<li>Gimbal must be balanced</li>
					<li>Gimbal must be light as possible</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Cost as always was a concern for this project as well, especially because Alpinax was a small startup.

				<p> The main casing of the gimbal was designed to be SLS printed out of nylon. I chose SLS printing because of the complex nature of the print ~ even though the case consisted of two parts, there needed to be overhangs to create the aerodynamic shape. The arms of the gimbal were designed to be milled out of 6061 aluminum to meet the structural requirements at relatively low weight. All axes were balanced using the mass properties function to find the center of mass along each gimbal motor axis.
