				<p> <h1>3D Printer</h1>
				<p> I bought the 3D printer as a kit right after graduation. The printer is a TEVO Tarantula, one of the lower end Prusa I3 style printers. So far I have gotten some use out of it, printing mostly calibration cubes and trinkets. There is a lot of potential for improvement, but as a random project I have really enjoyed working on and troubleshooting it.
