				<p> <h1>Racing Drone</h1>
				<p> I got the idea to build the racing drone after working at Alpinax. After doing some research and watching youtube videos, I ordered the parts and began to assemble. The project is still a work-in-progress, but hopefully I will finish soon now that I have more free time.
