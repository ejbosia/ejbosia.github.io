				<p> The Drone Delivery of Medical Supplies project was my capstone project working in a group of four students at WPI. The purpose of the project was to solve the problem of transporting cold-chained medical supplies, such as vaccines, across the last leg of the supply chain. The package needed to be a miniature refrigeration device light enough to fit on a drone, large enough to carry 0.4 liters of vaccine vials, and powerful enough to maintain a temperature range of between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The package design was essentially a short cylinder with a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) mounted on the bottom. Because of my experience with programming and electronics, I ended up working on the simulation and control side of the package.

				<p>My contributions to the mechanical design, aside from brainstorming with the team, were largely focused around developing a theoretical model of the thermodynamic system. To do this, I used the thermal resistance equations for conduction and convection in conjunction with MATLAB and Simulink. Initially I used MATLAB to quickly iterate through the potential design parameters and optimize our design. Afterwards I developed an in-depth Simulink model of the system in order to better model the nonlinear properties of the thermoelectric cooler and be able to predict the system response (MATLAB model only looked at end conditions). Using this model I could compare things like time to certain temperatures, feasibility at different ambient temperatures, expected battery life, and control stability.

				<p> For the SImulink model I needed to take into account the nonlinear relationship of the TEC heat moved compared to input voltage, as well as the heat characteristics of the package, coolsink, and heatsink. Aside from the complex TEC math, the primary structure of the program was a cycle between wattage, energy, and temperatures. I found each state using these equations (shown above). Thermoelectric coolers move heat related to the temperature differential between the hot and cold sides. I was able to use the temperatures of a small slice of the heatsink and coolsink to input into the TEC function block. The image below shows the Simulink model of the thermodynamic system.

				<p> When we got to the prototyping stage of the project, I switched from running simulations to building the control circuit and programming the microcontroller. The image below shows the result of the wiring. I designed the circuit to be powered either by a power supply or a 3s lithium polymer battery. The method of control was a simple relay - initially, I wanted to use an op-amp (OPA549) to amplify a DC signal voltage generated by low-pass filtering a PWM signal from our microcontroller, but the thermal issues caused by the high current draw from the TEC made it infeasible. The electronics also include GPS and GSM capabilities, as well as a basic user interface (not pictured) with LEDs and switches.

				<p>As for the result of our project, we were accepted to present at the University of Minnesota for the Design of Medical Devices Conference. We also advanced to the finals for the Provost's Design Award for Biomedical engineering at WPI. Overall the project was extremely rewarding for the time we put into it and a great way to finish off four years at WPI.
