				<p><h2>Industrial Robotics</h2>
				<p> March 2016 - May 2016
				
				<p> The final project for industrial robotics was open ended ~ we ended choosing to try to build a wall out of LEGOs using the IRB 1600 robot. The program for the robot was coded in the Rapid programming language. The wall we wanted to build is shown below.
				
				<table class="image">
					<caption align="bottom">SolidWorks Model of Wall</caption>
					<tr><td><img src="RBE4815/wall.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:1650;height:1100;"> </td></tr>
				</table>
				
				<p> We did not get to run the program in its complete form on the robot, but we were able to demonstrate pick and place with the LEGOs and a simulated version of the robot running the operation.
