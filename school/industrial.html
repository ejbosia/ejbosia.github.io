				<p> March 2016 - May 2016
				
				<p> The final project for industrial robotics was open ended ~ we ended choosing to try to build a wall out of LEGOs using the IRB 1600 robot. The program for the robot was coded in the Rapid programming language. The wall we wanted to build is shown below.

				<p> We did not get to run the program in its complete form on the robot, but we were able to demonstrate pick and place with the LEGOs and a simulated version of the robot running the operation.
