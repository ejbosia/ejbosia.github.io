            <p>The project for Unified Robotics I simulated replacing fuel rods from a nuclear facility. The robot had to vertically lift rods from a container, place the rod in a raised horizontal "waste" area, obtain a rod from a raised horizontal "supply" area, and then return this rod to the starting container. My responsibilities were focused on the mechanical aspects of the robot, including designing the drive system and the method of moving rods.

            <p>To manipulate the rods the robot had a combination of a slide-crank and servo mounted “wrist”. The slide-crank controlled the vertical motion of the rod, and the wrist allow the rods to change orientation. One of the specific design requirements was to use any type of four-bar linkage. Because the desired motion of the rod out of the vertical container was a straight vertical line, the slide-crank seemed to be the simplest and most effective option. The slide-crank and wrist are shown above.

            <p>I chose the wheelbase to be a modified differential drive (shown above). The robot navigated via line follow (sensors not pictured), so being able to turn in place was important. The three points of contact created a stable platform for the robot, as suspension was not available.</p>
