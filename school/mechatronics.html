            <p>The final project for mechatronics was to completely analyze a system using the bond graph method of system analysis. For the project we (part of a two person team) chose to analyze the drone I was planning to use for my capstone project taking off. The first thing we did was break the system into components and generate assumptions. After this was completed, we created the bond graph shown above.

            </table>
            
            <p> From the bond graph we developed a set of state equations. I plugged these state equations, along with the constants attributed to the drone, into MATLAB to solve the differential system of equations using the ode45 solver. The results of the simulation are shown below. The velocity profile matched the expected takeoff velocity and acceleration of the drone, meaning our assumptions did not ruin the simulation.
